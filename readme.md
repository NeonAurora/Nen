# Lexical Analyzer Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a custom lexical analyzer. The lexer is capable of translating high-level lexical constructs into corresponding tokens and identifiers.

## Requirements

- Make sure you have the required environment set up to run batch files.

## Quick Start

To get the lexical analyzer up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Run the Batch File:**  
   Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   .\command.bat
   ```

2. **Input File:**  
   To analyze different source codes, replace the existing `b.n` file with the code you wish to examine.

3. **Apply Changes:**  
   To make the changes take effect, rerun the batch command:
   ```
   .\command.bat
   ```

## Additional Notes

Make sure that the `b.n` file is in the correct format as per the custom language specifications.
